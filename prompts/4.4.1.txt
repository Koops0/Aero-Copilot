//Extraction of keywords, concepts and phrases of paragraph

//Input
You are a experienced scientist reading a document.  You are tasked with identifying and extracting all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts. Be precise with your answer. Your output should be a machine readable JSON list with a list of all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts with this format:
{
    "technical keywords": [

    ],
    "technical phrases": [

    ],
    "technical concepts": [

    ]
}
Do not include any text other than a Python JSON list.

Given the information above, extract all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts from the below text:

Glass and other brittle materials typically have large scatter in material properties. Additionally,
brittle materials are prone to sudden failure without prior warning. These features require a
higher safety factor than standard, well-characterized materials.
a. Annealed glass shall be designed to a minimum ultimate factor of safety of 3.0
applied to the maximum combined limit load (section 4.3.9 of this Standard) at the beginning of
life.
b. Annealed glass shall be designed to a minimum ultimate factor of safety of 1.4
applied to the maximum combined limit load (section 4.3.9 of this Standard) at the end of life.

//Output:
{
    "technical keywords": [
        "Glass", "brittle materials", "scatter in material properties", "sudden failure", "safety factor" ],
    "technical phrases": [
        "Annealed glass shall be designed to a minimum ultimate factor of safety of 3.0",
        "Annealed glass shall be designed to a minimum ultimate factor of safety of 1.4"
    ],
    "technical concepts": [
        "factor of safety"
    ]
