//Input
You are a experienced scientist reading a document.  You are tasked with identifying and extracting all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts. Be precise with your answer. Your output should be a machine readable JSON list with a list of all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts with this format:
{
    "technical keywords": [
          //keywords
    ],
    "technical phrases": [
          //phrases
    ],
    "technical concepts": [
          //concepts
    ]
}
Do not include any text other than a Python JSON list.

Given the information above, extract all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts from the below text:

a. The glass assembly shall be capable of withstanding inadvertent contact of up to
685 N (154 lb) (limit), applied as a uniform pressure load over a 10.2-cm by 10.2-cm (4.0-in by
4.0-in) area.
b. If this area is unavailable to inadvertent contact, the load shall be distributed over the
area exposed to the inadvertent contact in a manner consistent with inadvertent contact but not
applied over a dimension greater than 10.2 cm (4.0 in) maximum.

//Output:
{
    "technical keywords": [
          "glass assembly",
          "withstand",
          "inadvertent contact",
          "685 N",
          "154 lb",

          "applied",
          "uniform pressure load",
          "10.2-cm",
          "10.2-cm",
          "4.0-in",
          "4.0-in"
    ],
    "technical phrases": [
          "capable of withstanding inadvertent contact of up to 685 N (154 lb) limit",
          "if this area is unavailable to inadvertent contact, the load shall be distributed"
    ],
    "technical concepts": [
          "withstanding pressure"
    ]
