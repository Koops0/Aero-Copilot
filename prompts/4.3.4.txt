//Step 1 - Cohere
//Extraction of keywords, concepts and phrases of paragraph

//Input
You are a experienced scientist reading a document.  You are tasked with identifying and extracting all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts. Be precise with your answer. Your output should be a machine readable JSON list with a list of all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts with this format:
{
    "technical keywords": [
          //keywords
    ],
    "technical phrases": [
          //phrases
    ],
    "technical concepts": [
          //concepts
    ]
}
Do not include any text other than a Python JSON list.

Given the information above, extract all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts from the below text:

The flight or mission environment presents hazards, such as released shards or cracking
resulting from impacts on glass or ceramics, to crew safety and the structural integrity of the
vehicle/element.
a. All structural glass and non-structural glass or ceramic components exposed to tool
impact, e.g., the component design permits contact with the brittle material surface, shall not
create a hazardous condition when impacted.
b. All sources of potential impacts shall be considered, including but not limited to
MM/OD impacts, intravehicular activity (IVA) and extravehicular activity (EVA) inadvertent
contacts, IVA and EVA tool impact hazards, and launch debris impacts.
c. If these requirements cannot be positively demonstrated, then appropriate hazard
controls shall be implemented.

//Output:
{
    "technical keywords": [
          "flight", "mission", "hazards", "released shards", "cracking", "crew", "safety",
          "vehicle", "element", "structural integrity", "glass", "ceramics", "components",
          "exposed", "tool impact", "hazardous condition", "MM/OD", "intravehicular activity",
          "extravehicular activity", "launch debris"
    ],
    "technical phrases": [
          "shall not create a hazardous condition when impacted", "all sources of potential impacts shall be considered"
    ],
    "technical concepts": [
          "impact hazards"
    ]
