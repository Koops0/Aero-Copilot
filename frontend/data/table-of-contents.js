      "4.1 -- Introduction":
        "Glass is a brittle material that obeys Hooke’s law until failure. Glass failures result from tensile \nstresses and usually originate from a pre-existing flaw on or near the surface.  Flaws that \npropagate below the surface can emanate from manufacturing defects; good design and \nmanufacturing practice minimize all types of flaws on or near the surface.  \n \nThe strength of a particular glass composition and configuration can vary widely because of \nrandomly occurring flaws.  Often, manufacturing flaws in glass cannot be detected by visual \ninspection because the visible portion of the flaw is removed in the finishing process. \n \nFlaws in glass can be initiated easily by contact with objects; therefore, glass requires special \nprotection subsequent to manufacturing. \n \nFlaws in glass grow as a function of stress, flaw depth, environment, and time; this phenomenon \nis called static fatigue, flaw growth, or stress corrosion cracking.  Structural degradation occurs \nwith time for glass in tension, and failure can result if adequate precautions are not exercised.  \n \nBecause of the inherent structural characteristics of glass, special precautions and assumptions \nare required in the design, analysis, and verification of glass structural elements.",
