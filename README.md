## Introduction
Aero Copilot is a state-of-the-art document processing system backed by AI that streamlines and corrects technical documents so that NASA technicians can save time and money, so that they can focus on what really matters.

The process of running this application is simple. After they log in, the user can upload a PDF that will be parsed by the backend and broken down into the sections and the sub-sections. We then store the definitions that are already defined in the document for the future where it can be used to reduce falsely flagged texts. Next, we feed each section into the LLM with a custom prompt that allows the LLM to analyze the text like a human would and flag the ambiguous texts.

On a high level, we have used NextJS for the frontend, Python Flask for the API, AWS as the cloud provider and the Claude v2 model via AWS Bedrock as our trained LLM.

## System Overview
Aero CoPilotâ€™s system architecture is built using a microservices architecture using Amazon Web Services (AWS), LangChain and OpenAI. The system architecture is as follows:


<img src="screenshots/system.png" alt="System Architecture" width="600"/>

From a Next.js Web Application, an HTTP request is thrown to AWS Lambda, where technician sign-up and verification is provided by AWS Cognito and the profile is then stored using DynamoDB. Once a technician uploads a PDF in the website, it gets transferred to an AWS S3 bucket, parses the document via AWS Textract, then it goes through two prompts via LangChain and OpenAI. The first prompt scrapes all technical keywords, phrases and concepts for checking if a term is ambiguous, then it compares with another DynamoDB database with definitions. The remaining terms are then checked with a second prompt, to see if the words can be clarified further based on the context given in the paragraph.

## Getting Started

To get started with Aero CoPilot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies as outlined in the project documentation. For this project, you'll need an AWS account, Python and Node.js.
3. Set up your AWS Credentials.
4. Install the packages that are going to be used in the project.
5. Configure AWS services and environmental variables.

You can now create an account and import a PDF to Aero CoPilot
