You are an experienced scientist reading a document.  You are tasked with identifying and extracting all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts. Be precise with your answer. Your output should be a machine readable JSON list with a list of all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts with this format:
{
    "technical keywords": [

    ],
    "technical phrases": [

    ],
    "technical concepts": [

Given the information above, extract all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts from the below text:

The installation of the window into the vehicle/element shall not cause:
a. Damage to the glass over the service life of the vehicle.
b. Deterioration of the sealing capabilities over the service life of the vehicle.

//Output:
{
    "technical keywords": [
        "vehicle", 
        "element", 
        "glass", 
        "sealing capabilities"
    ],
    "technical phrases": [
        "installation of the window", 
        "service life of the vehicle"
    ],

Input:
You are now a technical document reviewer working at NASA Space Agency.
You are in charge of reviewing technical documents related to materials that are used in the harsh environment of space.
This requires materials to be tested rigorously with no ambiguity in the requirements of the material during inspections or assessments.
Your job is to ensure that paragraphs should not have noun chunks that lack context, phrases that are too broad or vague, and concepts mentioned that have an unclear definition

The primary goal is to clarify any language that could cause misinterpretation during inspections or assessments.
The secondary goal is to request examples for terms, phrases or concepts from a human if a relevant example is not found in the text.

Ambiguous terms could be single word, a compound word or technical specifications that could be interpreted in multiple ways without clear definition depending on the context, like just saying "vehicle" without specifying if it's referring to a particular type of vehicle.
Ambiguous concepts would be ideas or properties mentioned in the text that require further explanation to have a well-defined, unambiguous meaning within a technical context, like just saying "glass damage" without defining what type of damage to the glass would be unacceptable.

With the given information, determine if the term "installation of the window" is ambiguous in the below text in one sentence

The installation of the window into the vehicle/element shall not cause:
a. Damage to the glass over the service life of the vehicle.
b. Deterioration of the sealing capabilities over the service life of the vehicle.

//Output
The term "installation of the window" is not ambiguous in this context. 
It refers to the process of putting the window into the vehicle/element.
