//Extraction of keywords, concepts and phrases of paragraph

//Input
You are a experienced scientist reading a document.  You are tasked with identifying and extracting all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts. Be precise with your answer. Your output should be a machine readable JSON list with a list of all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts with this format:
{
    "technical keywords": [
          //keywords
    ],
    "technical phrases": [
          //phrases
    ],
    "technical concepts": [
          //concepts
    ]
}
Do not include any text other than a Python JSON list.

Given the information above, extract all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts from the below text:

Where applicable, spacecraft windows shall be capable of meeting the requirements specified
herein during all phases of the vehicle/element mission, including the launch, entry, and landing
phases and, if applicable, ferry flights or atmospheric transfers, after exposure to any single or
combination of the following environments:
a. Pressure (total pressure, positive and negative differential pressures, aerodynamic,
plume impingement).
b. Vacuum.
c. Thermal.
(1) Liftoff aerodynamic heating.
(2) On-orbit temperature extremes.
(3) On-orbit plume heating and thermal shock.
(4) Entry aerodynamic heating.
(5) Terrestrial.
d. Low-frequency and transient and dynamic loads.
e. Loads associated with pane failures.
f. Shock.
(1) Pyrotechnic.
(2) Landing impact.
(3) Handling.
g. Vibration.
(1) Random.
(2) Vibroacoustic.
h. Humidity.
i. Foreign Object Debris impacts.
j. Micro meteoroid/orbital debris (MM/OD) flux.
k. Fungus.
l. Ozone and atomic oxygen.
m. Rain.
n. Lightning.
o. Salt spray.
p. Solar radiation.
q. Geomagnetic trapped (Van Allen) radiation, both protons and electrons.
r. Acoustic noise.
s. Sand and dust.
t. Hail, snow, and ice.
u. Wind.
v. Acceleration.
w. Any other program-specific/mission-specific environments and conditions, including
loadings and chemicals, to which the vehicle/element can be exposed.
