//Extraction of keywords, concepts and phrases of paragraph

//Input
You are a experienced scientist reading a document.  You are tasked with identifying and extracting all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts. Be precise with your answer. Your output should be a machine readable JSON list with a list of all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts with this format:
{
    "technical keywords": [

    ],
    "technical phrases": [

    ],
    "technical concepts": [

    ]
}
Do not include any text other than a Python JSON list.

Given the information above, extract all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts from the below text:

a. The factor of safety applied to the load during the dynamic event precipitated by the
failure of a pressure pane shall be 2.0.
b. This factor shall be applied only to the dynamic event and in addition to the dynamic
amplification factor defined in section 4.4.3 of this Standard.
c. After quasi-static conditions are reached, the factor of safety specified in section 4.4.1
or section 4.4.2 of this Standard, as appropriate, shall apply.


//Output:
{
    "technical keywords": [
        "factor of safety", 
        "load", "dynamic event", "failure", "pressure pane", 
        "factor", "applied", "quasi-static conditions"
    ],
    "technical phrases": [
        "during the dynamic event precipitated by the failure of a pressure pane",
        "only to the dynamic event and in addition to the dynamic amplification factor defined in section 4.4.3 of this Standard",
        "after quasi-static conditions are reached"
    ],
    "technical concepts": [
        "safety factor", "dynamic event", "failure analysis", "static conditions"
    ]
}
