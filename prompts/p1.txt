//Extraction of keywords, concepts and phrases of paragraph

//Input
You are a experienced scientist reading a document.  You are tasked with identifying and extracting all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts. Be precise with your answer. Your output should be a machine readable JSON string with a list of all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts. Do not include any text other than a Python JSON string.

Given the information above, extract all the technical keywords, phrases and concepts from the below text:

Glass Pane-to-Seal (or Cushion) Interface
a. The window seal shall meet its performance requirements within the temperature
extremes of the seal-to-windowpane interface for the duration of the design life of the window,
precluding degradation from the environment or aging.
b. The window design shall prohibit the phase change (glassy transition) of the seal (or
cushion) material in contact with the glass at the lower temperature extremes of the seal/glass
pane interface.
In this context, the seal is any material in contact with the glass in the assembly.
The material does not necessarily have to function as a seal for this requirement to be
applicable.
