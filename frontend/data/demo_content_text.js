The window seal shall meet its performance requirements within the temperature extremes of the seal-to-windowpane interface for the duration of the design life of the window, precluding degradation from the environment or aging. b. The window design shall prohibit the phase change (glassy transition) of the seal (or cushion) material in contact with the glass at the lower temperature extremes of the seal/glass pane interface. In this context,the seal is any material in contact with the glass in the assembly. The material does not necessarily have to function as a seal for this requirement to be applicable."
