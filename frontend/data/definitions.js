    "Acceptance Test":
      "A specified level of testing in which all functional aspects of the hardware are thoroughly and systematically verified to ensure that the product performs according to the specification. Tests are conducted in accordance with an approved verification plan and approved test procedures. The test is required before acceptance, certification, and delivery of production hardware. It demonstrates that the hardware complies with specification requirements and is free of defects. Specific pass/fail criteria, tolerances, and test conditions are documented in implementing test requirements documents. The acceptance test verifies the workmanship of the flight hardware. Acceptance tests are performed on every deliverable unit.",
    "Brittle Material":
      "Materials, such as glass and ceramics, that are characterized by the fact that rupture occurs without any noticeable earlier change in the rate of elongation, i.e., there is no plastic deformation before fracture. The material will not yield under load before breaking. There is no difference between the ultimate strength of the material and its breaking strength.",
    "Catastrophic Hazard":
      "A hazard that can result in a disabling or fatal personnel injury or loss of flight hardware, ground facilities, or mission-critical equipment. Ceramics: Materials that are joined by ionic or covalent bonds and are complex compounds, consisting of both metallic and non-metallic elements. These are hard, brittle, high-melting-point materials with good chemical and thermal stability and high compressive strengths. The most important of the non-crystalline ceramic materials are glasses. Certification: This process consists of qualification testing, any major ground testing, acceptance testing, and any other testing and the analyses required to determine that the design hardware from the component through the subsystem level meets the specified requirements. Critical Hazard: A hazard that can result in a non-disabling personnel injury; damage to flight hardware, ground facilities, or mission-critical equipment; or loss of mission. Critical Stress Intensity (KIC): A material property that delineates the combination of stress and flaw size that will precipitate failure. This property is also referred to as fracture toughness. Design Life: The interval that begins with entry of a vehicle/element or part into operation or the design environment and ends with completion of its intended design mission. Dynamic Amplification Factor: The factor applied to a load to account for the dynamic nature of the load when applied on a structure. Dynamic amplification factors infrequently exceed 2.0. Flaw: An imperfection or discontinuity in the glass or ceramic. Flaws include scratches, pits, craters, bubbles, inclusions, chips, bruises, and cracks of any sort. Flaws may be acceptable or rejectable. Dynamic Factor of Safety: The factor of safety applied to the dynamic load during the application of the dynamic load. This factor of safety is reduced (from 3.0 (see section 4.4.1.a of this Standard)) since the dynamic load is well understood either by test or by enveloping theory. Flight Article: The hardware, firmware, and software unit that is used operationally in a flight environment. This unit is designed and manufactured under strict quality control, with complete records of unit manufacturing, testing, and shipping and handling. Glass: A large class of materials with highly variable mechanical and optical properties. Glass solidifies from the molten state without crystallization and is typically made by fusing silicates with boric oxide, aluminum oxide, or phosphorus pentoxide. Glass is generally hard, brittle, and transparent or translucent. Glass is an amorphous (non-crystalline) material that is isotropic and elastic. Glass",

      "The hardware, firmware, and software unit that is used operationally in a flight environment.

Glass: A large class of materials with highly variable mechanical and optical properties. Glass solidifies from the molten state without crystallization and is typically made by fusing silicates with boric oxide, aluminum oxide, or phosphorus pentoxide. Glass is generally hard, brittle, and transparent or translucent. Glass is an amorphous (non-crystalline) material that is isotropic and elastic. Glass Ceramics: Materials that are formed as a glass and then made to partly crystallize by heat treatment. Mechanically, they are very strong materials and can sustain repeated thermal shocks. They have very low heat conduction coefficients and can be made nearly transparent. Glass Pane or Pane or Windowpane: The glass structural component or element of a window. Initial Design Flaw Depth: The total flaw depth that is used to establish the allowable design stress that does not induce manufacturing flaws to grow to failure during the design life of the glass structure, assuming 100 percent moisture. Limit Load: The maximum anticipated load, or combination of loads, on the hardware during its design service life, including ground handling, transport to and from orbit (including abort conditions), and on-orbit operations. Margin of Safety (MS): A computation that demonstrates the structural reserve existing when comparing a material’s ability to sustain load to the predicted maximum service load with a factor of safety applied. Typically, the MS computation is written as MS = (Allowable stress/(predicted service stress x factor of safety))-1. For glasses and ceramics, the allowable stress is generally equal to the stress generated in the glass during an acceptance proof test. Modulus of Rupture (MOR): The failure stress in bending, as determined by bend test specimens or MOR bars. Non-Structural Glass: Any glass component that is not a part of a structural load path or a part of a pressure vessel. The only loads non-structural glass carries are inertial. Failure of this type of hardware does not violate redundancy requirements for crew safety but could cause the loss of an important function and could present a significant hazard. An example of non-structural glass is a camera lens that is not subjected to pressure loading. Qualification Article: A hardware, firmware, and software unit that is identical to the flight unit or production unit in form, fit, and function, as well as in manufacturing processes, parts, and quality control. This unit is used for verification and certification credit for all environmental requirements and performance requirements as needed. Qualification Test: A test program of statistically valid length under combined loads, cyclic loads, and time-varying environmental conditions that simulate conditions expected in service use. Qualification tests expose flight-like hardware to the actual environments in which it is expected to operate. The qualification test proves that the hardware, as designed, can function and perform in the applied environments over the design life. Pass/fail criteria are developed to define the minimum performance requirements that the flight-like unit under test has to meet for certification by NASA. Qualification test levels are applied with the appropriate specified test factors. Static Fatigue: In glass and ceramics, flaws grow as a function of stress, flaw size, environment, and time. The strength degradation with time resulting from the flaw growth is referred to as static fatigue. Structural",
