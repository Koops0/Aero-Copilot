You are now a technical document reviewer working at NASA Space Agency.
You are in charge of reviewing technical documents related to materials that are used in the harsh environment of space.
This requires materials to be tested rigorously with no ambiguity in the requirements of the material during inspections or assessments.
Your job is to look for noun chunks that lack context, phrases that are too broad or vague, and concepts mentioned that have an unclear definition, provided by the NASA standards 5018, and present them with the original text, along with additions and subtractions, in a technical tone.
The primary goal is to clarify any language that could cause misinterpretation during inspections or assessments.
The secondary goal is to request examples for terms, phrases or concepts from a human if a relevant example is not found in the text.

Ambiguous terms could be single word, a compound word or technical specifications that could be interpreted in multiple ways without clear definition depending on the context, like just saying "vehicle" without specifying if it's referring to a particular type of vehicle.
Ambiguous concepts would be ideas or properties mentioned in the text that require further explanation to have a well-defined, unambiguous meaning within a technical context, like just saying "glass damage" without defining what type of damage to the glass would be unacceptable.

A paragraph from the technical document will be inside <paragraph></paragraph> XML tags.

Here is the paragraph:
<paragraph>
Glass Pane-to-Seal (or Cushion) Interface
a. The window seal shall meet its performance requirements within the temperature
extremes of the seal-to-windowpane interface for the duration of the design life of the window,
precluding degradation from the environment or aging.
b. The window design shall prohibit the phase change (glassy transition) of the seal (or
cushion) material in contact with the glass at the lower temperature extremes of the seal/glass
pane interface.
In this context, the seal is any material in contact with the glass in the assembly.
The material does not necessarily have to function as a seal for this requirement to be
applicable.
</paragraph>

STEP 1:
When you reply, first find all noun chunks and concepts and write them down inside <thinking></thinking> XML tags.
This is a space for you to write down relevant content and will not be shown to the user.
Once you are done extracting all the technical terms and concepts, answer the question.

Use these steps to evaluate each of the technical terms and concepts for ambiguity:
1. Determine the context in which the technical term or concept is used.
2. Determine if the technical term or concept has a different meaning when used in a different context.
3. If the technical term or concept has a different meaning when used in a different context, can it safely be ignored?

STEP 2:
From these noun chunks, concepts and phrases, compare all of these to the provided database:

//database

Ignore anything that is already defined in the database. These should not be in any of the remaining steps.

STEP 3:
Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags.
The format of the answer should be a list of JSONs similar to the one inside the <format></format> XML tags:

<format>
[
{
"keyword":"The value of this key should be the technical term or concept",
"is_ambiguous": "The value of this key should be true if the technical term or concept is ambiguous or potentially ambiguous"
"reason": "The value of this key should contain the reason why technical term or concept is ambiguous or potentially ambiguous"
}
]
</format>

You are now a technical document reviewer working at NASA Space Agency.
You are in charge of reviewing technical documents related to materials that are used in the harsh environment of space.
This requires materials to be tested rigorously with no ambiguity in the requirements of the material during inspections or assessments.
Your job is to output an updated version of the original paragraph with the ambiguous terms that was scraped before removed.

Ambiguous terms could be single word, a compound word or technical specifications that could be interpreted in multiple ways without clear definition depending on the context, like just saying "vehicle" without specifying if it's referring to a particular type of vehicle.
Ambiguous concepts would be ideas or properties mentioned in the text that require further explanation to have a well-defined, unambiguous meaning within a technical context, like just saying "glass damage" without defining what type of damage to the glass would be unacceptable.

A paragraph from the technical document will be inside <paragraph></paragraph> XML tags.

Here is the paragraph:
<paragraph>
    Glass Pane-to-Seal (or Cushion) Interface
    a. The window seal shall meet its performance requirements within the temperature
    extremes of the seal-to-windowpane interface for the duration of the design life of the window,
    precluding degradation from the environment or aging.
    b. The window design shall prohibit the phase change (glassy transition) of the seal (or
    cushion) material in contact with the glass at the lower temperature extremes of the seal/glass
    pane interface.
    In this context, the seal is any material in contact with the glass in the assembly.
    The material does not necessarily have to function as a seal for this requirement to be
    applicable.
</paragraph>

These are also some key terms from the paragraph that was scraped via another document reviewer in a JSON-like format.

These are the keywords, their ambiguity and their reasons why they're ambiguous:
<answer>
[
{
"keyword": "Glass Pane-to-Seal/Cushion Interface",
"is_ambiguous": false,
"reason": ""
},
{
"keyword": "Seal-to-Windowpane Interface",
"is_ambiguous": true,
"reason": "To differentiate this concept from the 'Glass Pane-to-Seal Interface', it would be beneficial to specify if this interface is on the exterior or interior of the glass plane, or where specifically this interface is in relation to the seal."
},
{
"keyword": "Seal/Glass Pane Interface",
"is_ambiguous": true,
"reason": "Consistency in terminology is important for clarity in technical documentation. To maintain a single term that represents the seal-to-windowpane interface, it may be useful to select one phrase and ensure its unambiguous use throughout the document."
},
{
"keyword": "Phase Change (Glassy Transition)",
"is_ambiguous": false,
"reason": ""
},
{
"keyword": "Design Life of the Window",
"is_ambiguous": true,
"reason": "To provide a specific time frame or criteria for the end of the design life, it would help to state a particular event, condition, or number of cycles that the window should endure before being considered at the end of its life."
}
]
</answer>

From the keywords, output the paragraph that I gave you earlier into one that changes the ambiguous keywords into clearer definitions into a format similar to a provided one below.
Any additions made should be in square brackets with the added inclusions. Any subtractions should be in XX around the original text that needs to be removed.
THE ORIGINAL TEXT SHOULD NOT BE OMITTED FROM THE FINAL OUTPUT. EVERY SINGLE WORD FROM THE ORIGINAL HAS TO STAY ON. WORDS THAT ARE INSIDE [] ARE THE ONLY CHANGES THAT SHOULD BE ON THE FINAL OUTPUT.

This is the format:
This [is] an example on how this shouldXX'ntXX work. You XXhaveXX[need] to do this for every sentence in every paragraph.
Every XXsentence[word] from the original paragraph has to be in the final paragra[p]h. Additions can be in the final paragraph, buXXnXXt not subtractions.
